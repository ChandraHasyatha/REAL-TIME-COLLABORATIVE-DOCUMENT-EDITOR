The Online Learning Platform is a simple web application designed to simulate the core features of an e-learning system. This project includes the following key features:

Video Lessons:

The platform allows users to watch video lessons. After watching the video, users can mark the video as "watched," which will contribute to their progress in the learning platform.
Quiz:

A basic quiz section is included where users can answer multiple-choice questions. After submitting their answers, they receive feedback on whether their answer was correct or not. Completing the quiz will contribute to the user's progress.
Progress Tracking:

The platform includes a progress bar that visually displays the user's progress based on two main activities: watching the video and completing the quiz. The progress is tracked in percentage, and the bar fills up as the user progresses through the platform.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure for the web page (video section, quiz section, and progress section).
CSS: Used for styling the layout, including the design of buttons, progress bar, and responsiveness for different screen sizes.
JavaScript: Manages the interactivity of the platform, including marking the video as watched, submitting quiz answers, and updating the progress bar.
Features & Functionality:
Responsive Design:
The platform is responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Interactive Quiz:
Users can interact with a multiple-choice quiz. After selecting an answer, the platform provides feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
Progress Tracking:
The userâ€™s progress is tracked with a visual progress bar, updating after the video is marked as watched and the quiz is submitted.
Simple User Interface:
The design is minimalistic and user-friendly, making it suitable for educational platforms. Each section (video, quiz, and progress) is clearly defined.
How It Works:
Video Section:

The user watches a video lesson, and upon clicking the "Mark as Watched" button, 50% of the progress is completed.
Quiz Section:

The user answers the quiz question. If they answer correctly, the remaining 50% of the progress is awarded.
Progress Section:

As the user completes the video and quiz, the progress bar and text update to show how much of the learning path has been completed.
Project Files:
index.html:
Contains the structure of the platform including the video player, quiz form, and progress bar.
styles.css:
Provides the styling for the platform, ensuring a clean, modern design and responsiveness across devices.
script.js:
Handles the logic for interactivity, such as tracking progress, marking the video as watched, and checking quiz answers.
Conclusion:
This Online Learning Platform is a basic prototype that simulates essential e-learning features. It can be further extended with backend services to store user data (e.g., progress and quiz results), multiple lessons, and more advanced quiz functionality. The project provides a solid foundation for a more robust online learning system.
